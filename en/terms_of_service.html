    <h1 class="title">Monthly Subscription Auto-Renewal Agreement</h1>

    <h2>1. User Types</h2>
    <p>This app has two user types: subscribers (referred to as "members" below) and non-subscribers. Once a user purchases a monthly subscription, they are entitled to membership privileges during the subscription's validity period.</p>

    <h2>2. Purpose of Subscribing to Monthly Membership</h2>
    <p>Non-subscriber users can only access free resources. Member users, on the other hand, can access premium resources, including VIP-level content.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscription and Auto-Renewal</h2>
    <p>3.1 Subscription Plans: Only continuous monthly auto-renewal subscriptions are offered; no other forms of subscriptions are available.</p>
    <p>3.2 Auto-Renewal: Your subscription will automatically renew monthly starting from the subscription's commencement, unless you cancel auto-renewal before the current subscription period ends. Auto-renewal will continue at the current subscription price.</p>
    <p>3.3 Cancellation: You can cancel auto-renewal at any time within the Apple App Store. After cancellation, your membership service will terminate at the end of the current subscription period.</p>

    <h2>4. Pricing and Payment</h2>
    <p>4.1 Pricing: The price of the continuous monthly auto-renewal subscription is $0.99 per month. This price may vary slightly due to international exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
    <p>4.2 Payment: You agree to pay the fees for your selected continuous monthly auto-renewal subscription plan and authorize the company to process payments through the Apple App Store.</p>

    <h2>5. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>5.1 Privacy Policy: You agree to and accept our privacy policy, which contains detailed information on how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.</p>

    <h2>6. Termination and Refunds</h2>
    <p>6.1 Termination Rights: Members can apply for a refund by clicking the refund button within the app or through other refund methods provided by Apple.</p>
    <p>6.2 Refund Policy: Once a refund is successful, the user will lose membership status and become a non-subscriber, no longer entitled to membership-level services.</p>
