        <li>This application (referred to as "the App") is a tool designed to assist users in meditation, mindfulness, and focused contemplation. Its primary features include timing functionality and background sound options. The App stores data generated by user interactions in the cloud and synchronizes cloud resources with local caches.</li>
        <li>Currently, the App is available exclusively for the iOS platform and does not support other operating systems.</li>
        <li>The App is not intended for social networking purposes. It offers limited user customization and publishing capabilities, focusing primarily on essential settings and meditation data reporting.</li>
        <li>All data generated by the use of this App is stored in Apple iCloud. Therefore, users must grant the App network access and iCloud Drive permissions. Users are responsible for managing their private storage space quotas and associated fees, as the developer does not provide additional storage quota support.</li>
        <li>Data security and user privacy protection within this App are contingent upon the iCloud Drive service utilized by users. The developer cannot provide assurances beyond the service's capabilities. In cases where data loss or privacy breaches occur due to iCloud Drive service disruptions, the developer disclaims responsibility and any associated consequences.</li>
        <li>The App automatically synchronizes with resources stored in iCloud, including image and audio assets. It caches these cloud resources locally, maintaining consistency with iCloud-stored resources. Consequently, after synchronization, local cached resources may differ from previous versions, potentially including new additions, updates, or deletions.</li>
        <li>For functional purposes, the App may aggregate user-generated data resulting from their interactions and store it in a public iCloud database. This facilitates synchronization for statistical purposes or other functionalities, such as ranking systems.</li>
        <li>The App utilizes a unique user identifier within the developer's environment to distinguish and associate data from different users. This identifier is unrelated to a user's real-world identity and does not serve as a persistent, unique identifier or device tracking mechanism.</li>
        <li>The developer reserves the right to amend the terms and content of this privacy policy to accommodate changes in the App's functionality. The final interpretation of the privacy policy rests with the developer.</li>
        <li>This privacy policy may be available in multiple languages, including Chinese and English. In the event of any discrepancies or inaccuracies in translation between the Chinese version and other languages, the Chinese version shall prevail.</li>
        <li>By using this software, you signify your agreement to and acceptance of all the terms outlined above.</li>
    </ol>
