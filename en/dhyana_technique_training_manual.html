        <li>Find a space that ensures personal safety and is away from noise.</li>
        <li>Generally, choose a relatively quiet, well-ventilated indoor space. It's best if the place is comfortable in terms of temperature and humidity, and free from mosquito bites. If practicing outdoors, try not to do so alone.</li>
        <li>Sit cross-legged, maintaining an upright posture without leaning forward or backward.</li>
        <li>Maintain a straight and relaxed neck, tuck in the chin slightly without exerting force.</li>
        <li>Don't close your eyes completely; let your eyelids naturally lower with a slight gaze directed about 45 degrees downwards. Keep a gentle smile on your face.</li>
        <li>Start by taking deep breaths for a minute to stabilize your breathing rhythm. Afterward, don't intentionally adjust your breathing; let it return to its natural state.</li>
        <li>Don't deliberately visualize any scenes, nor try hard to eliminate thoughts. Let thoughts come and go in your mind; simply feel them without responding.</li>
        <li>Throughout this process, no matter how fascinating images and sensations appear in your mind, resist the urge to chase after them. These are just dreams of wakefulness; allow them to come and go.</li>
        <li>When you're done with the practice, slowly open your eyes, rise up, and leave the place.</li>
        <li>Don't share the scenes and sensations you experienced during the practice with other practitioners, so as not to lead others into an attachment of imitation and expectation, which may hinder self-aware enlightenment.</li>
        <li>It's advisable to set a daily practice goal for yourself to maintain your spiritual journey.</li>
