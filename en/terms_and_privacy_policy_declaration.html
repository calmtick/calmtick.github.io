    <h1 class="title">User Agreement and Privacy Statement</h1>

    <h2 class="title">Section 1: App Overview</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>This application (referred to as "the App") serves as a tool to assist with meditation, mindfulness, and mental clarity. Its main functions include timer settings and background sounds. The App stores generated data on the cloud and synchronizes cloud-based resources to local storage.</li>
        <li>Currently, the App is only available for the iOS platform and does not have versions compatible with other operating systems.</li>
    </ol>
    

    <h2 class="title">Section 2: Agreement and Privacy</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>By installing and using this App software, you confirm that you possess the legal capacity to act, are aware of the App's intended purpose, accept all the terms outlined in this agreement, and can independently bear all responsibilities for using this software. Consequently, you are solely responsible for any potential effects and consequences resulting from using this software.</li>
        <li>The App serves solely as an auxiliary tool and does not adopt any political or religious stance. The content within the App, including text, images, sounds, videos, and other resources, is presented for aesthetic or usability purposes and does not imply any political, racial, or religious inclinations. Any associations or actions arising from using the App are the user's own and are unrelated to the App itself.</li>
        <li>This software is not a social tool; apart from necessary configuration settings and reporting of practice data, it does not provide additional user-driven editing or publishing features.</li>
        <li>The App is exclusively operated by its developer and does not involve other partnerships or agencies. There are no off-platform activities associated with the App, and any activities falsely claiming such association are unrelated to the App's developer. As such, the developer does not bear any related responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Data generated through using the App is stored in Apple iCloud. Therefore, users must grant the App network access and iCloud Drive permissions. Users are responsible for their private storage quotas and associated costs; the developer does not provide additional storage quota support.</li>
        <li>The protection of user data and privacy depends entirely on the iCloud Drive service used by the user. The developer does not assume any liability related to this, including but not limited to service unavailability or data loss.</li>
        <li>The App automatically synchronizes with resources stored on iCloud, including images and audio files. Cloud-based resources are cached locally by the App, maintaining consistency with resources on iCloud. As a result of synchronization, the cached resources locally may not be identical to the previous version, potentially adding new resources, updating old ones, or deleting some.</li>
        <li>For functionality purposes, the App may aggregate user-specific data and store it in iCloud's public database, enabling synchronization of statistical results or other functions such as rankings.</li>
        <li>The source code, images, sounds, videos, and other resources used to create this software are copyrighted by the developer. The developer retains all rights and interests within the scope stipulated by applicable copyright laws and regulations.</li>
        <li>This agreement may exist in various languages, including but not limited to Chinese and English. In cases of conflicting or inaccurately translated statements between different language versions, the Chinese version prevails.</li>
        <li>By using this software, you signify your agreement to and acceptance of all the terms mentioned above. </li>
    </ol>
